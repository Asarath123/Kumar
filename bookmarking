The Indian team's worries ahead of its opening World Cup game against Australia has been compounded by in-form Shubman Gill's health issues and the batter is a doubtful starter for Sunday's match.

Ishan Kishan could be in line to open in case Gill is ruled out.

Gill, India's most prolific batter in ODIs in recent times, is reportedly down with high fever and will be tested for dengue on Friday before a final call is taken on the matter.

"Shubhman has had high fever since landing in Chennai. His tests are being done. He will have tests on Friday and a call will be taken on his participation in opening game," a BCCI source privy to team developments told PTI on the condition of anonymity.

It is learnt that Gill is being tested for dengue and in that case, he could well miss a couple of games.

Physical recovery of dengue patients vary and it normally takes around 7-10 days to be up and match ready. "Let's not jump the gun. If it's normal viral fever, he could play on antibiotics but it's completely the medical team's call," the source said.

Coming back to Shubman Gill, the Indian opener went down with dengue and missed  India's training sessions at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Wednesday and Thursday. Here the team management hoped Gill's illness to be nothing more than flu, but that was not to be the case as per Cricinfo.

"He is under the weather," the official update from BCCI had said. "The medical team is closely monitoring him. We are hoping he gets better soon."
